{.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n<a href=\"../en/index.qmd\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">English</button></a>\n<a href=\"../pt/index.qmd\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">PortuguÃªs</button></a>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.alert .alert-info role=\"alert\"}\nWelcome!\nI wrote this text in Portuguese in 2021, and this is the first translation post in this blog.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\n## Important\n\nThe RStudio Instructor Training and Certification program is currently [on hold.](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/)\n:::\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn 2020, I did the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) Instructor Training and Certification.\nThis post aims to describe how I did the training, possibly offer information, and help other people interested in undertaking this training.\n\n[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) offers the possibility to do the instructor certification on the packages [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).\nAll the necessary information is available [on this site](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/), but I will add some additional links here!\n\n> Important: I did the entire training process with [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson).\n> However, he is no longer involved with it.\n> I don't know if any of the steps have changed.\n> Here, I will describe the process when I did the training.\n\n## The importance of the R community\n\nFirst of all: I would like to point out that the R community was essential for me to be able to take this training.\n\nWhen I found out about the existence of this certification, I soon came across a difficulty in participating: on the website it said that it was necessary to pay (in dollars) to do the training.\n\nFor Brazilians, we know how the local currency is significantly devalued, making it difficult for many Brazilian people to participate.\nSo I let it go until I saw a [post](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2020_rstudiocertification_es/) by [Yanina Saibene](https://twitter.com/yabellini)'s blog talking about her experience in the training and certification.\n\nI talked to Yani (I met her in person at [LatinR 2019](https://latin-r.com/)) to find out more about what the training was like for her.\nShe put me in touch with a group of people who are part of [several chapters of R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) in Latin America, who were starting to organize a study group (and support!) to do the training.\nIn addition, she also gave me more information on how to make this financially possible.\n\nWe created a Slack channel for this study group, where we shared tips, exercise resolutions, and questions.\nIn addition, we had weekly Zoom meetings to discuss chapters from the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (also available in Spanish [this link](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/)).\n\nThe guidance from [Yanina Saibene](https://twitter.com/yabellini) and the support from the study group were essential for me to prepare for the exams and to feel confident in taking them.\n\n## How to start the training process?\n\nIf you are interested in carrying out the training process, the first step to getting started is to read the available instructions [on this page](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).\n\n> When filling out the form, carefully answer the two optional questions at the end of the form:\n>\n> -   The first is about being part of underrepresented groups in data science; in this case, describe well which groups you are a part of and point out your contributions to the R community.\n>\n> -   The second is about the reduction of the application fee (*fee waiver*) for people from developing countries (*lower-income countries*).\n\n## Training\n\nThe training I did was carried out online in two mornings, using Zoom.\nThe focus of the training was not on programming in R, but on teaching!\nAll the contents of the slides used are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY).\n\nA lot of the content presented was similar to the training offered by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and also the book [Teach Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/) (written by [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson)).\n\n## Certification exam\n\nAfter completing the training, the next step was to take the teaching and certification exam (in my case, it was about tidyverse).\n[In this link](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/) it is possible to access an example of exams made available by [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) for study.\n\nThere was no correct order to take the exams!\nAnother critical point is that the exams happened with the shared screen, and I could use Google search.\nBut the exam had a time limit, so it was essential to pay attention to the time spent searching!\n\n### Teaching exam\n\nThe teaching exam consisted of a 15-minute demonstration class and answering some questions about teaching.\n\nI had to send the materials used in the demonstration class beforehand.\nThe materials I prepared are available on this page: <https://beatrizmilz.github.io/RStudio_Certification/> (and the code is also available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/RStudio_Certification).\n\nI created a page for the material using the package [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) [@R-distill], the presentation with the package [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/) [@R-xaringan], two exercises using the package [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) [@R-learnr], the live code demo was using the [RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/), and a concept map created with the tool [CMap Tools](https://cmap.ihmc.us/).\nBut these are the tools that *I* choose to use, and I recommend that you use whichever is most comfortable for you!\nThe only mandatory tool to be used in this step is the [RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/) (which is easy to understand why...).\n\n### tidyverse exam\n\nThe tidyverse exam consisted of solving several exercises using R and tidyverse.\nThe recommendation from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is to read the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).\n\nI don't have much to say about this step; practice and use it as much as possible in your daily life and work, so you'll have more experience and solve problems faster during the exam.\n\n## Approval!\n\nAfter passing the exams, I received an email with a certificate, and they asked me for some information to add me to the list of certified trainers.\nThe page containing my information can be accessed [here](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/milz+beatriz/), and the certificate received was this:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Certificate received after completing the Tidyverse Instructor Certification'.](https://beatrizmilz.com/img/certificado-rstudio.jpg){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn addition, I got an invitation to participate in an RStudio Slack channel, where other people that did the training talk about topics related to the training, such as teaching, didactics, R, tidyverse, shiny, among others.\n\nAnd I couldn't miss the celebration either.\nDue to the pandemic, the meeting with friends was online.\nThere was also a thank you tweet:\n\n<center>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\nMuito feliz em dizer que sou uma instrutora de <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tidyverse</a> certificada pela RStudio!\nðŸŽ‰<br><br>I'm so happy to tell that I'm a certified tidyverse Instructor!<\nbr><br>Thanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gvwilson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gvwilson</a> and @RStudioEDU for this great opportunity.\n<a href=\"https://t.co/NL4SeT4mxN\">https://t.co/NL4SeT4mxN</a>\n\n</p>\n\n--- Beatriz Milz (@BeaMilz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeaMilz/status/1312129792771125255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2020</a>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n```{=html}\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n```\n\n</center>\n\n## What about the language?\n\nIn my opinion, it is important to have some experience with English, because the training is live and in English.\nI don't know if RStudio has plans to provide training in other languages (like [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), where there are already some training offerings in Spanish).\n\nThe exams that I did were applied by [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson) and accompanied by [Daniel Falbel](https://twitter.com/dfalbel) (who is Brazilian and works at RStudio in the development of the [Torch for R](https://torch.mlverse.org/) and is also one of the founding partners of [Curso-R](https://curso-r.com/)).\nDaniel's participation made it possible for me to present the teaching demo entirely in Portuguese and be able to answer the exam questions in Portuguese.\nI want to record my thanks to Greg Wilson for presenting this possibility and Daniel Falbel for agreeing to be part of this process!\nIt was essential for me to feel more relaxed during the exam, as I would have to worry less about the language and more about the content of the exams itself.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor me, doing this process was a rich experience where I learned and reflected on important content so that I could share more and more quality content about R.\nI wish that more people from the Latin American community could go through the training process.\n\n## Acknowledgements ðŸ’œ\n\nI've already made several acknowledgments throughout the text, but I want to highlight my gratitude to people who were fundamental to this process:\n\n-   Team at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson), and [Daniel Falbel](https://twitter.com/dfalbel): thank you for making this training possible!\n\n-   [Yanina Saibene](https://twitter.com/yabellini), for telling me what steps to take!\n\n-   It wasn't easy to keep the motivation of studies during the pandemic, but studying in a group helped a lot to continue.\n    So, for the people who studied with me, I appreciate the moments of study, exchange, support, and help with Spanish.\n\n    -   [Riva Quiroga](https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga)\n    -
