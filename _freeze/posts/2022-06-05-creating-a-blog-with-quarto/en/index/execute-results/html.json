Click the `Project:` button, and then in `New Project...`:\n\n![](img/new_project/01-new-project.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n2.  Choose `New Directory`:\n\n![](img/new_project/02-new-directory.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n3.  Choose `Quarto blog`:\n\n![](img/new_project/03-new-quarto-blog.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n4.  Choose the directory name (the name of the folder where your blog will be stored) and where in your computer you want to save it. Then click `Create Project`:\n\n![](img/new_project/04-name-and-path.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n5.  Voilá! The structure of your blog is ready 🎉. Check the `Files` panel and explore the files stored there.\n\n![](img/new_project/05-project-created.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n## 4 - Preview your blog\n\nYou can preview how your blog is going to look like if you open an `.qmd` file and click the **Render** button.\nThe preview of your blog will show on the Viewer Pane in the RStudio IDE.\n\n![](img/render.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nBut you can also click the **Show in new window** button (circled in red in the image above) to preview it in your browser:\n\n![](img/preview.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nNice!\nYour blog exists on your computer now.\nBut we still need to put it online, so other people can read your posts.\nIn the next two sections I'll show you how to do that!\n\n## 5 - Create a GitHub repository\n\nUsing Git and GitHub will help you to put your blog online (and also have an online copy of the code in case anything happens with the version in your computer).\n\nYou need the package [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) for this part:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n### What is Git? GitHub? (Click to expand!)\n\nIf you have not used Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE before, I recommend you to take some time to prepare your environment and configure everything before continuing reading this post.\n\n**You can read detailed information about how to do this in the book [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/).**\n\nHere is a useful check-list you can use:\n\n-   [ ] [Install Git on your computer](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n\n-   [ ] [Create a free account on GitHub](https://github.com/)\n\n-   [ ] Install package [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/): `install.packages(\"usethis\")`\n\n-   [ ] Introduce yourself to Git:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  # your name\n  user.name = \"Captain Marvel\",\n  # your email used in your GitHub account\n  user.email = \"awesomecaptain@gmail.com\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   [ ] Create a GitHub PAT Token with `usethis::create_github_token()` (is like a password)\n\n-   [ ] Store your token with `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`\n\n-   [ ] Restart your R Session (usually `CTRL + SHIFT + F10` will do the work)\n\n-   [ ] Use `usethis::git_sitrep()` to check if your name, email and PAT are configured.\n    The most important thing to look for is: `Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'`.\n\nIf it is all configured, you are ready to continue reading this post.\n🚀\n:::\n\nIf you already configure Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE, you can use these two functions from the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package, in the project that you created:\n\n1.  `use_git()` to start the version control of your project (the function will ask you if you want to commit your changes and restart RStudio, you can accept it):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_git()\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Desktop/name-of-your-blog/'\n# ✔ Initialising Git repo\n# ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user', '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to '.gitignore'\n# There are 8 uncommitted files:\n# * '_quarto.yml'\n# * '.gitignore'\n# * 'about.qmd'\n# * 'example-quarto-blog.Rproj'\n# * 'index.qmd'\n# * 'posts/'\n# * 'profile.jpg'\n# * 'styles.css'\n\n\n# Is it ok to commit them?\n# \n# 1: Not now\n# 2: Yup\n# 3: Negative\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\n# ✔ Adding files\n# ✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'\n# • A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane\n# Restart now?\n# \n# 1: No way\n# 2: Definitely\n# 3: No\n# \n# Selection: 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  `use_github()` to create a GitHub repository to store your code, and a new window will open with your repository:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_github()\n# ℹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/beatrizmilz/Desktop/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Creating GitHub repository 'beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog.git'\n# ✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch\n# ✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](img/new-repo.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nThis is the repository used in this example: <https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog>\n\n## 6 - Deploy with Netlify\n\nNext, we will create a URL to put the blog online.\nThis step is called **deploy**, and we will use a service called [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for this purpose.\n\n1.  First, Sign up or Log in on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).\n    I recommend signing in using your GitHub account.\n\n2.  Then, you can click **Add new site** and **Import an existing project**:\n\n![](img/netlify/add-new-site.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n3.  Next, you need to connect to a Git provider. In this case, click the link to GitHub. It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub if you have not done this already.\n\n![](img/netlify/connect-to-git.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n4.  Then, in **Pick a repository from GitHub**, choose the repository that you created for your blog:\n\n![](img/netlify/pick-repo.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n5.  This step is really important, so don't hurry up and take your time to do it with care! In **Import an existing project from a Git repository**, you **only** have to change one thing: the **Base directory** field. You need to write the name of the directory used to store the HTML files of your blog. By default, it is `_site`. This is because when you generate your blog, by default Quarto saves all the HTML files generated for your site in the directory called `_site`. Everything else will be filled out by Netlify, so don't change anything else. Check if everything looks like the image below and then click **Deploy site**:\n\n![](img/netlify/site-settings.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\n6.  When you first deploy a website on Netlify, it will show an automatic URL. In this case it was *peppy-cat-2e067c.netlify.app*. You can change it to a more personal URL, which would be easier for other people to type and remember. To change your site URL, click **Site settings**:\n\n![](img/netlify/first-deploy.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nThen click **Change site name**:\n\n![](img/netlify/site-details.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nAnd choose the name used for the URL of your blog, writing it on the field **Site name**.\nBelow this field, you can see how the URL of your blog is going to look like!\nAfter choosing it, click **Save**.\nIf you need, you can change it after.\n\n![](img/netlify/change-site-name.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nNow the blog that I am creating as an example is available in this link: <https://your-awesome-blog-with-quarto.netlify.app/>\n\n## 7 - Change the colors of your blog {#change-the-colors-of-your-blog}\n\nYou can change the colors, fonts and more of the style of your blog by changing the **theme** in the file `_quarto.yml`.\nYou can create your own theme or choose between the options on the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#overview).\n\nOpen the `_quarto.yml` file and choose another theme that you liked from the documentation.\nIn this example, I changed the theme to `minty`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.yml .cell-code}\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: minty\n    css: styles.css\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](img/theme.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nIf you know CSS and would like to change the theme yourself, you can edit the `styles.css` file.\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n### How can I update my blog with the changes I made? (Click to expand!)\n\nIf this is your first time using Git and GitHub in RStudio IDE, I'll show you the steps to update your blog!\n\nFirst, you need to find the Git Pane in RStudio IDE. If it is not there, I recommend restarting RStudio and opening your project again.\n\nThen, in your Git Pane, the list of files with changes will appear.\nCheck the boxes of the files that you want to update, and click **Commit**:\n\n![](img/git-pane/stage.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"} Next, you need to write a message that, in a few words, explains what was changed.\nWrite this message in the **Commit message** field, and the click **Commit**:\n\n![](img/git-pane/write-commit-message.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nFinally, close the Git window, then click **Push** (it is the green up-arrow button on the Git pane).\n\n![](img/git-pane/status.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nAfter all the changes are sent to GitHub, the Git Pane will be empty, meaning that there are no new changes:\n\n![](img/git-pane/no-changes.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nNow, wait a minute and then check your blog online!\n:::\n\n## 8 - Setting up Comments\n\nIt is nice to add a comments section on our blog posts, so people can write their opinion about it.\n\nThe [quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting) explains how to add comments with three different options: [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/), [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) and [Giscus](https://giscus.app/).\nYou can use whatever suits you best.\n\nI chose to use [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) and here I'll tell you how to set it up!\n\n1.  Your repository needs to be public on GitHub.\n    The default is to be public, it will only be private if you changed it (you can change it back on your repository settings on GitHub).\n\n2.  Install the [Giscus App](https://github.com/apps/giscus).\n    Go to [this website](https://github.com/apps/giscus) and click the **Install button**:\n\n![](img/giscus-install.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nThen, Giscus will ask you in which repositories you would like to give permission to Giscus.\nYou can choose what you prefer.\nI chose to give access only to the repository that I'm going to need this service, so I chose **Only select repository** and pick the repository of the blog.\n\n![](img/giscus-repo.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\n3.  You have to enable the **Discussions** in your repository. First, go to your repository, and click **Settings**:\n\n![](img/github-repo.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nThen, scroll down to the **Features** sections, and check the box of the **Discussions**.\n\n![](img/enable-discussions.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\n4.  Open the `_quarto.yml` file and add this code. Remember to update the information of your repo: in this example is `beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog` because `beatrizmilz` is my GitHub account, and `name-of-your-blog` is the repository of this example blog.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.yml .cell-code}\ncomments:\n  giscus:\n    repo: YOURGITHUBACCOUNT/YOURREPO\n```\n:::\n\n\nRemember to commit all the changes before checking the online version!\nIf you missed that, go back to the end of [section 7](#change-the-colors-of-your-blog) and read the collapsed tip.\n\nNow we have a comments section on the blog!\nPeople need to log in with GitHub in order to write a comment or give a reaction:\n\n![](img/giscus-deployed.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tip\n\nWhen we activate the comments, as default they appear in almost every page!\nYou can hide the comments in specific pages by adding `comments: false` in the YAML headers of `*.qmd` files that you want to hide.\n:::\n\n## 9 - Add content in your blog\n\nYour blog is live!\nNow you can make some changes and add your content in it.\nHere is a list of things that you might like to do!\n\n-   `_quarto.yml`: In this file, you can do a lot of things, such as: changing the name that will appear in the blog, add links to your twitter and GitHub account, change the navigation bar options, and so on.\n    You can check how I configured this in [this file](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/blog-en/blob/main/_quarto.yml).\n\n-   Write about yourself, so people can get to know you.\n    You can do that in the `about.qmd` file.\n    There, you can add links to your social media, a photo, and other information about you that you think might be relevant.\n    You can change the template of this page, in the `template` option.\n    You can check all the templates [in the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html).\n    In this [personal blog](about.qmd), I chose to use `trestles`.\n\n-   Write blog posts!\n    Your blog posts are stored in the `posts/` directory.\n    Each post has to have a folder, and inside this folder you need a `index.qmd` file.\n    But follow along the template that is already there and you will be good to go.\n    Also, I recommend checking the awesome options described on the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html).\n\n-   If you are out of ideas about what to write, my advice is to write something that you already know, want to learn, or something that you like a lot.\n    I enjoy reading blog posts that people write about topics they are interested in!\n\n## 10 - Tweet about it!\n\nCongratulations, you have created your blog with Quarto!\n✨\n\nAfter writing your first blogpost, you can start sharing it to the world.\n📢📢📢\n\nMy suggestion to you is: Write a tweet!\nYou can use the [`#rstats` hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RStats&src=typeahead_click) if the content of your blog is about R and you can cite [\\@quarto_pub](https://twitter.com/quarto_pub).\n\nIf this post was relevant to you, you can also cite me with [\\@BeaMilz](https://twitter.com/BeaMilz), so I can retweet about your blog!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTo me, a person who is used to using blogdown, Quarto is an awesome tool, has simple code and is full of great documentation.\nI also think that the experience is similar to using [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/).\n\nI hope this content was useful and that you enjoy the reading.\nPlease let me know in the comments if there is anything that is not clear!\n\n# Thanks!\n\nThanks for reading this post, and now I would like to thank awesome people that, without their work, this post would not exist:\n\n-   The team that developed Quarto ([here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/graphs/contributors) and [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/graphs/contributors)).\n    They continue to improve it, they answer questions on the [Discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/discussions), and they wrote that [AWESOME DOCUMENTATION](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)!\n    🏆\n\n-   [Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/) - she is an important part of the R and R-Ladies community, and she wrote tons of content about writing blogs with R.\n    I have been learning from her material since 2018 (when I started to create my [blog in Portuguese](https://beatrizmilz.com/talk/)).\n    A lot of what I know about creating blogs with R, I learned from her materials and talks.\n    Thanks Alison 💜.\n\n-   [Julio Trecenti](https://twitter.com/jtrecenti) is my partner.\n    We talk about Quarto a lot, and I learn so much from him.\n    Apart from that, I would like to thank him for reviewing my content and always supporting me ❤️.\n\n# Edit: More content about this topic!\n\n-   [Albert Rapp](https://twitter.com/rappa753) wrote a [\"tweetutorial\": a twitter thread](https://twitter.com/rappa753/status/1531692573126959106?s=20&t=ZZEhdvLXRRvL2NEUhj7oFg) with a lot of tips to customize blogs made with Quarto.\n\n# Edit 2: Tweet\n\nHere is my tweet about this blog post:\n\n<center>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\nI started a new blog to write content in English.<br>The first post is 'Creating a blog with Quarto in 10 steps'<a href=\"https://twitter.com/quarto_pub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@quarto_pub</a> <br><br>In this post, I introduce you to my new blog and show how you can create a blog with Quarto:<a href=\"https://t.co/u9Umh3X5eu\">https://t.co/u9Umh3X5eu</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rladies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rladies</a> feedback is welcome!\n\n</p>\n\n--- Beatriz Milz (@BeaMilz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeaMilz/status/1533534492702408704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2022</a>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n```{=html}\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n```\n\n</center>\n",
